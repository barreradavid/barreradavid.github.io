<div class="body" id="detail">
	<p> Hello everybody my name is David I'm 15 years old, I live in San Jose California with my family, I was born and raised In Guatemala, I like to play the piano to relief stress. I also like to hear classic and EDM Music. I don't like sports mostly beacause I don't consider myself good in any sport. Currently I'm a SMASH scholar at Satnford University, the college of my dreams, the program is a five weeks summer camp where we recieve STEM classes. During the school year I attend to San Jose High School. I'm interested in computer science but in the future I want to be a neurosurgeon. My native lenguage is spanish and I'm still an english learner. I want to learn at least one more lenguage after english but I don't know wich lenguage I want to learn. I also like to play videogames and watch Science fiction Movies. This was a little bit about me that I wanted to share, please contact me if you have any questions. My contact information will be in the CONTACT ME TAB. Thank you for your time.</p>
